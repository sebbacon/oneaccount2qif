This is a script to scrape your one account data and convert it to QIF format, so you can actually do useful things with it.

I've not bothered making it nice yet.

Right now:

 * Copy settings.py.in to settings.py and edit.
 * Run ./oneaccount.py once to grab today's HTML 
 * Run it again to dump QIF format to stdout.
